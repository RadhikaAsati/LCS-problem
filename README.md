# LCS-problem
Implement Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the length and LCS for DNA sequences.
Problem Statement:
DNA sequences can be viewed as strings of A, C, G, and T characters, which represent
nucleotides. Finding the similarities between two DNA sequences are an important
computation performed in bioinformatics.

TASK-1: Find the similarity between the given X and Y sequence.
X=AGCCCTAAGGGCTACCTAGCTT
Y= GACAGCCTACAAGCGTTAGCTTG
Output: Cost matrix with all costs and direction, final cost of LCS and the LCS.
